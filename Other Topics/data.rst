Data Management
+++++++++++++++++++++

Although there are a lot of ongoing efforts to achieve standardization and interoperability of glider data, we are not there yet. Every glider (and every oceanographic instrument in general) produces their own version of output data with their no standard format, vocabulary or metadata.
The goal here is to follow the `FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ and existing efforts listed below to create an open data format that might one day be adapted by the community.
