Data Management
+++++++++++++++++++++

Although there are a lot of ongoing efforts to achieve standardization and interoperability of glider data, we are not there yet. Every glider (and every oceanographic instrument in general) produces their own version of output data with their no standard format, vocabulary or metadata.
The goal here is to follow the `FAIR principles <https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/>`_ plus existing efforts and standards listed below to create an open data format and visualization tool that might one day be adapted by the community.

* `OceanGliders OG Format <https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/OG-format-user-manual/OG_Format.html>`_
* `OceanGliders Controlled Vocabulary <https://oceangliderscommunity.github.io/OG-format-user-manual/vocabularyCollection/tableOfControlledVocab.html>`_
* `OceanSITES <https://goosocean.org/who-we-are/observations-coordination-group/global-ocean-observing-networks/oceansites/>`_
* `SeaDataNet data management protocols for glider data <https://repository.oceanbestpractices.org/bitstream/handle/11329/2118/Seadatanet%20data%20management%20protools.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y>`_
