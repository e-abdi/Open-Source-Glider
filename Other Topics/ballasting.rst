Ballasting
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two major factors that need to be considered for a well-ballasted glider. 

The first is its density. Gliders have a limited displacement available for getting up and down the water column (typically around 1L). So the first decision is where in that one liter you want to place the neutral position of your glider. The lazy answer would be in the middle.But the compromise here would be between how much thrust you will have for flying through the water and how much buoyancy extra buoyancy you want to have for making sure glider will get back to the surface.  Depending on the location, glider might need to pass through a sharp `thermocline <https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/thermocline.html#:~:text=A%20thermocline%20is%20the%20transition%20layer%20between%20the%20warmer%20mixed,a%20sudden%20change%20in%20temperature>`_ or when you expect to have a distinct layer of fresh water at surface, for instance close to a river discharge. So to be on the safe side, you always want to have a little more on the buoyancy side. But how much? Because sometimes you need as much thrust as you can get to fight through a strong current for instance. So these are decisions that need to be made while performing a mission planning.

To add weight, we typically use lead bars and to add buoyancy, we usually use `syntactic foam <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_foam>`_. 

After ballasting a glider for buoyancy, now it's time to make sure center of gravity and center of buoyancy are in positions where allow the glider to fly efficiently through the water. This is done by moving weights and foams up and down the body.
