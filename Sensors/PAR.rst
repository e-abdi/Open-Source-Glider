PAR
++++++++++++++++++
A PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) sensor measures the amount of light available for photosynthesis in the ocean or in the air.
It detects the light in the range that plants and algae use (about 400 to 700 nanometers). Scientists use PAR sensors to understand how much energy is available for marine plants and tiny algae (phytoplankton) to grow.
