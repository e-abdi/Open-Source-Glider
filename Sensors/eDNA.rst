eDNA
++++++++++++++++++
eDNA stands for environmental DNA, which is DNA that animals, plants, and microorganisms leave behind in the environment â€” like in water, soil, or even air.
Scientists can collect samples and look for tiny pieces of DNA to figure out what species are or were present without needing to see or catch them.

eDNA is a powerful tool for studying biodiversity, tracking rare or invasive species, and monitoring ecosystem health, all with minimal disturbance to the environment.

The `DoT eDNA <https://www.dartmouthocean.com/products/edna/>`_ is one of the most advanced samplers available on the market and we are currently working on integrating it on a Slocum glider.
