CTD
++++++++++
This is a standard sensor on all gliders. There seem to be a few good low-cost and/or open options for us to use here. `Here <https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD>`_ is an open-source version. There is also `this <https://atlas-scientific.com/probes>`_ website which seem to have other sensors such as oxygen and PH!
