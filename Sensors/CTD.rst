CTD
++++++++++
Stands for Conductivity, Temperature and Depth. This is a standard sensor on all gliders. Conductivity can be used in conjunction with temperature and depth to measure water salinity.
The most common method of measurement is the use of a conductivity cell in which seawater flows through two electrodes. Applying a voltage to this electrodes results in a current proportional to water salinity.
There seem to be a few good low-cost and/or open options for us to use here. `Here <https://github.com/OceanographyforEveryone/OpenCTD>`_ is an open-source version. There is also `this <https://atlas-scientific.com/probes>`_ website which seem to have other sensors such as oxygen and PH!
