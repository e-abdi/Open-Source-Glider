Software
+++++++++++++++++

Seaglider and Slocum vary quite a lot in their sofrware structure and in this aspect again I will try to implement the best ideas from each design, but the overall structure will be mostly based on Seaglider code. 

The main idea here is to use the existing open-source and community driven software and tools available for drones and planes and not to start from scratch. Therefore we will be using the `PX4 <https://docs.px4.io/main/en/>`_ ecosystem. 


`Here <https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d89ac4b4-7b93-4b6b-a87e-13086683a3e1/edit?viewport_loc=-588%2C-849%2C2994%2C1373%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_726f0295-7bba-4cce-93db-fac1e61b2ddb>`_ you can find the current version of the proposed code flowchart. Any comments and contributions are welcome.
