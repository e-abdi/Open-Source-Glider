Seaglider and Slocum vary quite a lot in their sofrware structure and in this aspect again I will try to implement the best ideas from each design, but the overall structure will be mostly based on Seaglider code. 


`Here <https://lucid.app/lucidchart/d89ac4b4-7b93-4b6b-a87e-13086683a3e1/edit?viewport_loc=-588%2C-849%2C2994%2C1373%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_726f0295-7bba-4cce-93db-fac1e61b2ddb>`_ you can find the current version of the proposed code flowchart. Any comments and contributions are welcome.
