Strobe light
++++++++++++++++

Useful for locating the glider especially when it's dark. But you need to be able to control when exactly it comes on, cause otherwise it could attract unwanted attention and ultimately be more dangerous for the glider.
Seaexplorer and Oceanscout both have a nice strobe solution which is built into the antenna. Slocum has a small one next to their antenna. Seaglider does not come with a strobe, so you need to install your own if you need one.
