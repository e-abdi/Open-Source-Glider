Buoayncy Drive system
++++++++++++++++++++++++
This section of the glider as the name suggests, by varying the total density of the glider, varies its buoyancy and causes the glider to dive or climb the water column.

Piston Design
------------------
This design is much simpler and achieves quicker displacement but it's less efficient the deeper you go. So generally is used for gliders that dive down to around 200m but any deeper design, uses a bladder.


In Slocum, they use a 90-watt motor and a rolling diaphragm seal to achieve this.

Bladder design
-------------------
At surface a normally-closed solenoid valve is opened and oil is pushed inside the pressure hull. This makes the glider denser than the water so it dives. When glider reaches the desired depth, it will pump oil back out into the external bladder and this will cause the glider to climb up the water column.
