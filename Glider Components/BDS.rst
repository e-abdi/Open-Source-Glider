Buoayncy Drive system
++++++++++++++++++++++++
This section of the glider as the name suggests, varies the total density of the glider, and therefore changing its buoyancy causing the glider to dive or climb the water column.


Piston Design
------------------
This is basically a large piston that displaces sea water to achieve buoyancy change. This design is much simpler and usually achieves quicker displacement but it's less efficient the deeper you go. So generally is used for gliders that dive down to around 200m but any deeper design, uses a bladder.


In Slocum, they use a 90-watt motor and a rolling diaphragm seal to achieve this.

Rolling Diaphragm
************************

A rolling diaphragm is a type of seal in which most of the pressure is supported by the piston head and only a very small amount of pressure is exerted on the narrow convolution between the piston and cylinder. I believe this has a lot of advantages on its alternative which is a piston seal and that's why it's the preferred method. In a piston seal, tolerances are really important and lubrication is necessary.

Bladder design
-------------------
At surface a normally-closed solenoid valve is opened and oil is pushed inside the pressure hull. This makes the glider denser than the water so it dives. When glider reaches the desired depth, it will pump oil back out into the external bladder and this will cause the glider to climb up the water column.
