Pressure hull
+++++++++++++++++

Seaglider pressure hull is made from several pieces of machined 6061 aluminium whereas Slocum uses carbon fiber hulls.  
Carbon fiber composites generally are not well know for their compressive strength. They work best in tension like for airplanes where they are pressurized from inside. Read `this paper <https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/10/1456>`_ for more info.
Since glider are going through consecutive cycles, these need to be rigorously fatigue tested, otherwise could easily lead to an implosion like the infamous `titan incident <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion>`_.
In fact catastrophic pressure housing failure could be the cause of many suspicious Slocum disappearances throughout the years.

Seals
---------------

There are generally two types of seals used in underwater housing. Face (or flange) seals and radial (or piston) seals. Again, I will compare Seaglider and Slocum designs here. Seagliders use a few flanges with a single o-ring, whereas Slocums use radial seals with double o-rings. In my experience, Slocums seals are far more susceptible to a leak than Seagliders. This makes sense to me because face seals are generally more forgiving and easier to maintain. I have deployed Seagliders with serious flange damage and in general, as long as the glider will maintain a vacuum in the lab, there won't be a leak at sea. But Slocums might hold a vacuum in the lab, but if not a perfect o-ring job is done, there might be a leak at depth.
