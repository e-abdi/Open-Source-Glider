Pressure hull
+++++++++++++++++

Seaglider pressure hull is made from several pieces of machined 6061 aluminium whereas Slocum uses carbon fiber hulls.  
Carbon fiber composites generally are not well known for their compressive strength. They work best in tension like for airplanes where they are pressurized from inside. Read `this paper <https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/10/1456>`_ for more info.
Since glider are going through consecutive cycles, these need to be rigorously fatigue tested and acoustically inspected fairly regularly for any cracks, otherwise could easily lead to an implosion like the infamous `titan incident <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titan_submersible_implosion>`_.
Catastrophic pressure housing failure could be the cause of many suspicious Slocum disappearances throughout the years.
SeaExplorers and OceanScouts also have aluminium hulls.

Seals
---------------

There are generally two types of seals used in underwater housing. Face (or flange) seals and radial (or piston) seals. Again, I will compare Seaglider and Slocum designs here. Seagliders use a few flanges with a single o-ring, whereas Slocums use radial seals with double o-rings and a central tie rod to hold everything together. In my experience, Slocums seals are far more susceptible to a leak than Seagliders. This makes sense to me because face seals are generally more forgiving and easier to maintain. I have deployed Seagliders with serious flange damage and in general, as long as the glider maintains a vacuum in the lab, there won't be a leak at sea. But Slocums might hold a vacuum in the lab, but if not a perfect o-ring job is done or if there is some slight scratch on the seal face, there might be a leak at depth. Slocums face leaks regularly because of this and there are even leak detector sensors in different sections to determine if there is actually water inside. I have even heard that a tiny amount of water inside is not that uncommon. There is no such thing in a Seaglider. I believe this is because of the fact that despite the use of a tie rod, a glider still wiggles slightly in the real world. Combine wiggle and pressure, and it's not hard to get some water inside.

Pressure Relief Valve
-----------------------
This is an important component of any subsea housing containing batteries. Batteries can produce gas (especially when they fail) which can cause a pressure to build up inside a pressure housing. This can be extremely dangerous and casue massive explosions. To avoid this, use of a pressure relief valve is essential. Seagliders uses these but Slocums for some reason don't!
