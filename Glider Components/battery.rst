Battery
+++++++++++++++++

It's important to remember that one of the most important properties of gliders is their endurance.
Therefore power output is not as important as energy density and safety.



Lithium Primary
=========
Generally has around twice volumetric energy density compared to rechargeable options.
The popular cells in marine domain (at least ones that are more accessible in EU) are Saft specifically the LS33600 and LSH20 cells.  
Seaglider uses Electrochem cells in their packs


Lithium Rechargeable
==============
Both Slocum and SeaExplorer offer a rechargeable batteries which is quite convenient for certain types of operation.
