Attitude control
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section generally moves the battery (the heaviest item inside) forward and aft to achieve pitching down and up respectively. For Seagliders it also rotates the battery clockwise or anticlockwise to achieve port and starboard roll respectively. In the case of Slocums, there is no roll and the change in heading is achieved by a rudder, therefore changing glider's yaw. The advantage of this method is more responsive and manoeuvrable but this comes with disadvantage of introducing an external moving part which can malfunction (as this actually happens sometimes) resulting in loosing the ability to steer the glider completely.
