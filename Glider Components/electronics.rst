Both Seaglider and Slocum used a combination of Persistor CF2 and Tattletale 8 (TT8). But I am not sure exactly how. Persistor was a microcontroller with a compact flash and Tattletale was a mini computer capable of running DOS. I guess the Persistor was a supervisor and would only turn to TT8 when specific tasks were going to be carried out.
